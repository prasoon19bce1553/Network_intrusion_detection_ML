# Network_intrusion_detection_ML
Detecting any intrusion in 
the packets over a network becomes a very importing task to classify 
different types of packets without decrypting the contents to detect any 
intrusions in the network. For this we have taken three datasets namely 
NSL-KDD, KDD_Finaldata and KDD99 from Kaggle and organised into a 
pre-processed dataset by data processing. After that we have applied 3 
Machine Learning models onto each dataset to determine the dataset 
with the best model accuracy and also one better than the pre-existing 
implementations. Three Machine learning models are namely Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost. The best 
dataset is found as the KDD99 with the best model accuracy as 
XGBoost.
